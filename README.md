# Global-antibiotic-resistance-analysis
Excel-based exploratory data analysis of WHO GLASS data (2017–2020) to identify global, regional, and bacteria-specific antibiotic resistance trends using pivot tables and visualizations.

# Global Antibiotic Resistance Analysis (WHO GLASS Data)

This project analyzes global antibiotic resistance trends using WHO GLASS data (2017–2020).
The analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel, focusing on data cleaning, validation,
pivot-based analysis, and visualization.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Conditional Formatting (Heatmap)
- Line & Column Charts

## Key Analysis
- Year-wise resistance trends
- WHO region-wise comparison
- Bacteria vs antibiotic resistance heatmap
- Top 5 most and least resistant antibiotics

## Key Insights
- Older and commonly used antibiotics show higher resistance
- Restricted or last-resort antibiotics show lower resistance
- Resistance varies across bacteria–antibiotic combinations

## Purpose
This project demonstrates practical data analysis skills and the ability to convert
real-world healthcare data into actionable insights.
